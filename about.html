			<br>My name is <b>Vee</b>, I'm an artist from Brazil. I am bisexual and nonbinary (Pronouns: They/It/She) and also autistic.
			<br>My main trade is as a digital illustrator and character designer, but I also dabble in pixel art, writing, independent game development and music.
			<br>I am very passionate about various forms of media, particularly other indie projects like games and webcomics as well as some more mainstream stuff, like various game series as well as comics, anime and manga.
			<br>I love Kirby, Sonic the Hedgehog, Undertale/Deltarune, Chainsaw Man, fighting games like Guilty Gear and Them's Fightin' Herds, Final Fantasy, The Owl House, and plenty of other things.
			<br>I have a number of original characters and projects I want to make real at some point, primarily in the realms of video games and my own webcomics, which I intend to host on this same website.
			<br>I have a downright encyclopedic knowledge of game lore that nobody else really cares about, as far as I'm aware, but I'm still willing to share if asked (And sometimes unprompted :3c)
